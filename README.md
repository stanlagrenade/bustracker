<p>This project demonstrates how APIs can be leveraged to integrate map data from Mapbox to create animations. This project calls functions triggered by a button to animate bus stops between MIT's Campus to Harvard's campus. This project is from  Week #8. The challenge was to animate and add features to a map view of a Boston bus route and then add markers along the way for credit.</p>
